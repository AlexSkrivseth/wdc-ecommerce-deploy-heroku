# Ecommerce Deploy to Heroku

### Setup Instruction

The structure of the whole Django project is built for you. Run the following commands in order to have your local environment up and running.  

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv -p $(which python3) ecommerce
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now run the development server and point the browser to the correct URL:

```bash
$ make runserver
```

### Description

The goal of this practice is to perform a deploy of the Ecommerce project that we've been working on, into a production environment.

For this task you'll need to use the service [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), in a similar way that we did during the class.
